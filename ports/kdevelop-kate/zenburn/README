zenburn v 0.1

Zenburn is color scheme for kdevelop/kate, heavy inspired by Jani Nurminen's  (eye-gentle) color-scheme for vim.  Primarily it's intended for PHP/HTML, SQL, C  and some *nix script languages (e.g. bash) and config files (e.g. fstab). Other may need tuning.
PS Change font to you favourite.

Installation:
1) Either run install.sh script or _append_ the content of files kateschemarc.zenburn and katesyntaxhighlightingrc.zenburn to ~/.kde/share/config/kateschemarc and ~/.kde/share/config/katesyntaxhighlightingrc respectively.
2) Change 'Default schema' to 'zenburn' (kate/kwrite/quanta/kdevelop/etc.)

To do:
- make it more compatible with original zenburn.
- complete syntax highlighting for other languages (if you make some syntax schemes and would like me to incl. it - please let me know and send it).
